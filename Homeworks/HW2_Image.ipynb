    "# I'm Picking Up Crop Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will examine crop rotation in the state of Illinois. One of the most common patterns of crop rotation is corn being rotated with soybeans. You have two years of Cropland Data Layer (CDL), 2016 and 2017, from which to examine how common the phenomenon is in Illinois. \n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: you will need to make use of the CDL documentation to answer many of these questions.\n",

    "1. Clip the 2016 and 2017 CDL rasters to the state of Illinois. (2 points)\n",
    "2. Summarize the top 10 land uses in Illinois in each year. (2 points)\n",
    "3. Create two rasters for each year: (2 points)\n",
    "    - 1 if pixel is corn, 0 otherwise\n",
    "    - 1 if pixel is soybeans, 0 otherwise\n",
    "    \n",
    "    And then plot them.\n",
    "4. Describe the degree of crop rotation (corn and soybeans only) between 2016 and 2017. (2 points)\n",
    "5. Create a raster using the CDL layers where each pixel is labeled: (2 points)\n",
    "    - 1 = corn stayed corn\n",
    "    - 2 = soybeans stayed soybeans\n",
    "    - 3 = corn changed to soybeans\n",
    "    - 4 = soybeans changed to corn\n",
    "    - 0 = any other case.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Visualize the raster on top of the Illinois shapefile. (__BONUS GRAPH__: To submit your graph for two extra credit points, please put a markdown cell above your graph code that says \"__My Submission__\") (3 points)\n",
    "7. Suppose a client has the following question: (4 points)\n",

    "    __\"What are the crop yield advantages of crop rotation as compared to monocropping in Illinois?\"__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Describe how you might answer this question using the CDL layer, specifically:\n",
    "       - What data sources you would need in addition to the raster you just created.\n",
    "       - How you would manipulate the data.\n",
    "       - What statistics you would calculate or model you would run on this data.\n",
    "       - How you might present your findings.\n",
    "8. What factors would make it difficult to accurately answer the question? List three and explain why they might make answering the question difficult. (3 points)"
