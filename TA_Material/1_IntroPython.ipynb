Here we will focus on the <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>, which makes use of [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for interactive scripting. Other programming languages can be used in a Jupyter Notebook through [kernels](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) (IPython is a kernel maintained by Project Jupyter). Finally, [Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html) can be used to create a graphic interface for interacting with scripts and displaying results. This is just a small part of the Jupyter Ecosystem - there is more to explore in future notebooks!"
